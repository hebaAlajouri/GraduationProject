                <p>We found this website getting the inspiration from our experiences with tawjihi year in jordan,
                    because we experienced the the diffeculty of communication with teachers and finding a real reviws
                    about those teachers especially real students ,and also we have experienced the feeling of lost
                    ,because we had to visit many websites to collect the information about those teachers .</p>
